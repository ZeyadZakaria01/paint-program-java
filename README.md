# TL;DR
This is a paint program using Java and Java form the GUI, we also used a lot of design patterns in to the application.
The goal of this design is to provide a painting tool that allows the user to draw forms, color them, and make adjustments. 
Only the user's mouse and imagination are required to create the desired image. 
To make the painting process more forgiving for the user, the user may utilise a range of tools such as resize, copy, move, and alter colour, all with an undo-redo option.
