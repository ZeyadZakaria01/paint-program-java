# Paint Program
This is a Java-based paint program with a graphical user interface (GUI) that incorporates various design patterns. Its purpose is to offer a versatile tool for users to create drawings by allowing them to draw shapes, apply colors, and make adjustments. The program makes use of the user's mouse and creativity to generate desired images. To enhance the user experience, it provides several features like resizing, copying, moving, and changing colors, all accompanied by an undo-redo functionality.
